This repo was created to work on 2branch strategy.

@Gautam, @Mitravardhan post cloning the repo, create local working branches from "feature" branch only.

Post few commits and having a stable piece of demo code you ca raise PR's to merge with main branch.

Currently the review properties are not set up, kindly commit locally until tommorrow.
